    The skills section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can list out the various skills that you possess that are relevant to the job you are applying for. This section allows you to highlight your strengths and demonstrate your capabilities to potential employers.

    The skills section can include both hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are specific technical abilities or knowledge related to a particular job or industry, such as proficiency in programming languages or experience with certain software programs. Soft skills are more general personal traits and abilities, such as communication skills, leadership, problem-solving, or teamwork.

    When crafting your skills section, it's important to tailor it to the specific job you are applying for, and only include skills that are relevant to the position. This can help catch the attention of the hiring manager and demonstrate that you have the qualifications necessary to succeed in the role.

    There are multiple ways to present your skills here. One way is to show them in a rating format. Another way is to group them together. Alternatively, you can use markdown to format it in a way that you prefer.

    The interests section in a resume typically refers to a section where you can mention your hobbies, interests, and activities outside of work or school. This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    However, it is important to be selective when including an interest section in your resume, and to choose interests that are appropriate and professional. Avoid including controversial or potentially offensive interests, and focus on interests that showcase your positive qualities and strengths.
